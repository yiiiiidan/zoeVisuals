### Introduction
This repository contains R codes created for dynamic visualization. The essence is to use ggplot2 package with a loop and ggsave function to generate frames of an animation. Then I used Photoshop to make those into gif files. Still, it totally depends on your creativity which utility you would use to set them dynamic.

### How to make them dynamic?

I recommend using no more than 90 frames. It would be enough to show each frame for 0.05~0.07 second. This will vary according to the type of the graph and the number of frames.

### What is done so far?
